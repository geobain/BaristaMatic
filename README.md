# BaristaMatic
Barista coffee dispensing application
The coding assignment was to create a simulator of an automatic coffee dispensing machine, called the Barista-matic. The machine maintains an inventory of drink ingredients, and is able to dispense a fixed set of possible drinks by combining these ingredients in different amounts.The cost of the drink is determined by its component ingredients.

Upon startup, the Barista-matic should display a list of its current inventory, followed by a menu to allow the user to select a drink. As drinks are dispensed, the inventory should be updated. Only drinks for whch there is sufficient inventory can be dispensed. 

Drink Name    Ingredients
